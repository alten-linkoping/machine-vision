# Machine Vision

## Functional specification:

This is a web application that visualizes object detections of moving objects. 

###  features

* Create an application that can visualize/play sequences from the dataset and overlays

* Modify application to use network to identify moving objects in the sequences and display the object as an overlay on the sequence

* Add more functionality, either by adding more features in the current network or by adding a trained neural network.



## Technological specification:



* Client-side: HTML

* Server-side: [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
