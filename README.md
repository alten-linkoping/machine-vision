# Machine Vision

This is the repository for an internal project at Alten Link√∂ping, with the aim of developing the skills of employees. 
The main functionallity of the project is a detection algortihm core that either identifies motion or people, and a visualization application. 

At this stage the project consist of three different solutions:
* A NodeJS web application with a C++ algorithm core. 
* A HTML web application with a Python algortihm core using tensorflow classification networks. 
* A local Qt application with a C++ algorithm core.

### Branch info

The solutions can be found in their individual folders in the master branch. Any changes should be done in the indidual branches and then merged with the master branch.
* Folder: node (NodeJS and C++) - Branch: combined
* Folder: python (HTML and Python) - Branch: computervision-python
* Folder: peopleDetection (Qt and C++) - Branch: Qt-c++

Individual README-files can be found in each folder specifying the details for each part.
