# Machine Vision

## Functional specification:

This is a Qt application that visualizes object/people detections.


###  features

* Create an application that can visualize/play sequences from the dataset and overlays

* Modify application to use network to identify moving objects in the sequences and display the object as an overlay on the sequence

* Add more functionality, either by adding more features in the current network or by adding a trained neural network.
