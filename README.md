# Machine Vision

## Functional specification:

This is a web application that visualizes object detections of moving objects. 

###  features

* Create an application that can visualize/play sequences from the dataset and overlays

* Modify application to use network to identify moving objects in the sequences and display the object as an overlay on the sequence

* Add more functionality, either by adding more features in the current network or by adding a trained neural network.



## Technological specification:

* Client-side: JavaScript, HTML, CSS 

* Server-side: [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

* Algorithmic core: [C++](http://www.cplusplus.org/)

* Libray for image processing algorithms: [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) Version 4.1.0_3

* Dataset: [Multiple Object Tracking Benchmark](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17/)

* Task management: [Jira](https://support.alten.se/projects/MAC/summary)

* Code Review for Git [Gerrit](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/)
