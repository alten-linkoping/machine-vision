# Machine Vision

## Functional specification:

This is a web application that visualizes object detections of cars. 

###  features

* Create an application that can visualize/play sequences from the dataset and overlays

* Train a network to identify cars in the dataset

* Modify application to use network to identify cars in the sequences and display the object as an overlay on the sequence

* Add more functionality, either by adding more features in the current network or by adding new networks



## Technological specification:

* Client-side: [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

* Server-side: [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

* Algorithmic core: [C++](http://www.cplusplus.org/)

* Training networks: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

* Dataset: [Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/data/)
